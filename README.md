## Introduction

Creating and working with large datasets is a common task in data analysis and processing. This code example focuses on generating a Pandas DataFrame with a substantial number of rows and applying various transformations to it. The code also calculates an SHA-256 hash of the DataFrame to ensure data integrity.

## Code Overview

The code consists of the following key components:

- The `GenerateDataFrame` class: This class encapsulates the process of creating the DataFrame, setting the index, and calculating the hash. It also includes a data generator for populating the DataFrame with random data.

- The `generate_data` method: This method generates random data for the DataFrame. Data is generated in chunks to manage memory efficiently.

- The `set_index` method: This method sets the index of the DataFrame, ensuring data integrity.

- The `calculate_hash` method: This method calculates the SHA-256 hash of the DataFrame.

- The `get_hash` method: This method collects and concatenates the hashes obtained from different DataFrame chunks.

- The `generator` method: This method generates random data points for the DataFrame.

- The `run` method: This method orchestrates the entire data generation and hash calculation process, breaking the data into manageable chunks.

## How to Use

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Import the required libraries.
2. Adjust the `TRANSFORMS` and `ROWS` variables to specify the number of transformations and rows you want in your DataFrame.
3. Execute the code.

Sample usage:

```python
dataframe = GenerateDataFrame(ROWS, TRANSFORMS)
df = dataframe.run()
df_hash = hashlib.sha256(dataframe.get_hash()).hexdigest()

test_hash = "867567dc7d46f77af2bca9804ac366a5165d27612de100461b699bd23094ab90"

assert df_hash == test_hash
